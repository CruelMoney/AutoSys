abstract={The development of software engineering programs is a formidable undertaking. Undergraduate software engineering curricula are currently at an "early adopter" stage and few schools are willing to risk developing a whole new program (or completely overhauling an existing program). There are serious problems for the development of such programs: the software engineering profession is immature; there is confusion about the difference between computer science and software engineering; there is a lack of understanding and appreciation among computer science faculty about the need for software engineering education; there is little available material on curriculum guidance; and there are currently no accredited programs in software engineering. For a number of years the WGSEET (Working Group on Software Engineering Education and Training) has been working to advance the state of software engineering and training. A recent effort has been the development of a set of guidelines that would assist faculty in developing software engineering programs. In this paper we describe a "curriculum model" that is an outgrowth of the guidelines work of the WGSEET. The curriculum model supports the development of a variety of degree programs which emphasize and focus on software engineering (e.g., software engineering, computer science, information systems, and computer engineering). The model provide an overall architecture, a set of design guidelines, descriptions of software engineering curriculum content that can be used to design courses and curricula, and several sample curricula.},

abstract={Agent-oriented enterprise software engineering (AOESE) has emerged as a promising approach to developing Web-based enterprise software systems. AOESE is based on developing and evolving enterprise software systems from selected pre-engineered and pre-tested software agents, and then assembling them within appropriate software architectures. We view agent-oriented software engineering as an extension of conventional component-based software engineering, and software agents as next-generation software components. Software agents offer greater flexibility and adaptability than traditional components. However, making transition to agent-oriented enterprise software engineering requires software engineers to learn a new set of technical skills. To provide such a learning opportunity, the author has created a new course sequence that integrates both agent-oriented enterprise software engineering and component-based enterprise software engineering into software engineering curriculum. A new course in the sequence is intended to provide students with the opportunity to acquire a good understanding of the key concepts and principles of agent-oriented enterprise software engineering, and the new opportunities and challenges involved in developing Web-based multi-agent systems. The course is designed to help build a solid foundation for integration of research into education in the area of agent-oriented enterprise software engineering. The course has special emphasis on developing architectures and frameworks for Web-based multi-agent enterprise systems rather than developing single agent. In this paper, the author shares her experience of developing the course, and presents the course organization, its components, and the future plans for the course.},

pages={223-228}, 
abstract={Software process is the most important part of software project management, and software process models are important means of implementing the software process in any software organization. When there is need to improve the software process, then the need to improve the work-task part (software process models) of the software process must arise. As, there is need of increasing the commitment of software project managers through out the software development life cycle (SDLC), so we need to give them the list of activities in Waterfall Model, which should be made efficient by the software development team, to get the 80% productivity (output) easily, by reducing the effort of software development and ultimately increasing the performance of the software process. So, the idea of 80/20 rule (Pareto Principle, 1935) can be applied in the software engineering process model, in this regard. The Pareto Principle (1935) directed us to focus on what is really important in any field and field's work. Software process is most important part of software project management (SPM). This is also then ultimately needed for software project management (SPM) improvement. Our main research work is to improve the work-task part of the software process (i.e. software process models by applying the Pareto Principle - 80/20 Rule (1935) (or law of vital few) (1935), in the software engineering process models (or work-task part of the software process). This will be to facilitate the software project manager, using the software process models practically more efficient than without application of 80/20 Rule in software engineering Waterfall model. This has resulted in the reduction of the software development effort and increase in the performance of the software process. The results (efficient and improved software process models) will be implemented in the software industry, by software project managers, by focusing on the list of activities giving 80 percent of the overall productivity o- f the software process. The results will be the list of activities having the capability to give 20 percent of the overall productivity of the software Waterfall process, to be ignored, eliminated or designated to reduce the effort.},

abstract={Component-based enterprise software engineering (CBESE) is a rapidly emerging trend in the software engineering area. In the CBESE approach, software systems are no longer built from scratch. Instead, reusable software components, built by in-house developers or commercial vendors, are used as the building blocks of new component-based enterprise software systems. The transition from traditional software engineering to component-based enterprise software engineering is often blocked or hindered by a variety of engineering, process-related, business-oriented, infrastructure, organizational and management issues. Resolving those issues requires a systematic approach to building a component-based and reuse-driven software engineering business. That is why software engineers need to acquire a new set of skills. This has introduced the need for a new course sequence that integrates component-based enterprise software engineering into the software and information engineering curriculum. A new major course in this sequence is focused on component-based and reuse-driven software engineering businesses. In this paper, we share our experience of developing such a new course. The course is intended to provide a solid foundation for integrating of research into education in the area of component-based enterprise software engineering.

We expect that researchers in educational software engineering would be among key players in the education domain and in the coming age of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Educational software engineering can and will contribute significant solutions to address various critical challenges in education especially MOOCs such as automatic grading, intelligent tutoring, problem generation, and plagiarism detection.

abstract={Software Engineering is about creating high-quality software in a systematic, controlled, and efficient manner. Although the Software Engineering discipline had been recognized since 1968, there is still no agreement among the Universities worldwide about what should be included in the Software Engineering curriculums or study plans. This problem has resulted in that different knowledge areas are being taught to the Software Engineering students in different universities. Also this problem has resulted in that many universities now include courses in the Software Engineering curriculum that are not related to Software Engineering. A case study of the Jordanian Universities had proved that more than 60% of the courses taught at the Software Engineering departments of the Jordanian Universities are non Software Engineering related courses. An analysis had been conducted to compare the current Software Engineering courses taught at the different Jordanian Universities and the guidance provided by the ACM/IEEE about what should constitute an undergraduate Software Engineering education. Also an analysis of the Software Engineering courses taught at different countries such as UK and USA had been conducted where these countries were chosen because they contain many of the top ranked Universities in the world. The analysis had resulted in determining the knowledge areas that should be added to the curriculum of each Jordanian University. Enhancing the curriculum will result in a SE graduates that are equipped with the needed knowledge to join the software market.},

abstract={Software based products are an ever increasing portion of industrial output. However few engineers who produce software have had formal training in the specification, design, implementation, documentation, and maintenance of large software systems. In addition, few have had training in software engineering management and development tools and processes. KSU has implemented a Master of Software Engineering degree program which provides an opportunity for new engineering graduates and practicing engineers to learn state of the art software engineering analysis and processes. The purpose is to provide students a foundation in the software engineering “life cycle”, software measurement, software management, software specification, and software validation and verification. In addition to the core courses on software methodology, students are required to take courses in an application area which is reliant on software development. This involves faculty from many engineering and science disciplines who teach these courses and supervise the development of the student's software “portfolio” in the designated engineering or science area. The goal is to integrate the software engineering process into traditional engineering processes},

year={2014},

pages={100-109}, 
abstract={Software projects that are engineered using global software development techniques are required to deploy processes and tools to support collaboration over large geographies. Specifically, these projects involve the deployment of processes and tools to support project management, communication, and risk management. Whereas a traditional software development effort can use standard processes and tools to support communication and collaboration, global software development efforts require a unified and holistic project management, development process, collaboration, and communication approach taking into consideration the interplay of time zones, number of sites and cultural diversity. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for modeling and quantification of global software engineering frameworks. In our approach, we apply transient survivability metrics to support the design of global software engineering projects. Therefore, our approach combines survivability analysis and global software engineering frameworks analysis. The survivability metric used in this paper is the time required to recover from a software project disaster (e.g., break down in communication between remote teams) for a given global software engineering framework. The global software engineering modeling framework we use is composed of models supporting the evaluation of communication tools, software development processes and cultural diversity management. We illustrate the application of our approach by applying it to the analysis of an example derived from a real global software engineering project. Our results indicate that the combination of survivability analysis and modeling of global software engineering frameworks can provide meaningful insights when designing global software engineering frameworks.},

abstract={The questions that are proposed as the basis for academy panel sessions are important ones to ask. In the aggregate, they cover an enormous expanse of the software engineering landscape. The reality of undergraduate computing education is that the vast majority of students do not go through software engineering curricula where there is time to address the academy questions in some depth. Instead, they are in computer science or computer engineering programs, and receive their software engineering education in a single course. What students should really learn in this first, and often only, software engineering course is important because the majority of computing students will not see any other software engineering. The course designer will need to make judicious choices in selecting the material for this course because all of software engineering will not fit in just one course even if you try by using one of the classic software engineering tomes as the textbook. I do not know the right answer to the question I pose in the title of this position paper. I suspect that there is no one set of software engineering topics that should be included, but rather a range of topics to select from based on the purpose and perspective of the course. The answer to this question is important to everyone who has responsibility for providing the software engineering education for the next generation of computing students.},

abstract={Summary form only given. Many masters-level programs have been created to address the need for more professional software engineers. A question remains, however, as to the place for software engineering in undergraduate studies. To date, most work in undergraduate software engineering education has been performed by small clusters of computer science and engineering faculty, widely dispersed throughout academia. Building on recommendations from the Software Engineering Institute (SEI), the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), and the IEEE Computer Society, these initial efforts have begun to bear fruit. Typically, the result is a set of software engineering courses arranged according to one of the following formats: (a) an elective or required course sequence; (b) elective noncredit paracticums; and (c) software engineering topics introduced in existing courses. The paper discusses: (a) What is the proper relationship between typical engineering programs and those in software engineering? (b) How should software engineering education differ from both computer science and computer engineering? (c) If undergraduate program degrees in software engineering are developed, how should such programs interact with other engineering programs? and (d) How are minors and concentrations in software engineering affected by the presence of a baccalaureate in software engineering?},

It leads to increasing the need for training students and experts in the academic centers with software developing skills in accordance with the engineering principles and disciplines. However, one of the main challenges in the software engineering education is how to teach engineering disciplines to the students so that we can inspire the engineering concept to them. To do so if we use educational methods for teaching this course, which can show the usage of engineering disciplines to the students in practice and demonstrate the impact of their application on creating the engineered software products, we will achieve more qualified and engineered products in the future. To accommodate the application of engineering notion at different stages of the software development lifecycle, we have proposed an experience based approach in this paper that can help teaching software engineering principles and practices through experiments. Reviewing the results of the experiments by students will be helpful to learn software engineering concepts and use them for developing more engineered software.},

To overcome these issues, researchers suggested number of software engineering learning/teaching methods to egg on students to acquire their profundity knowledge in software engineering. Even though the suggestions do not utterly surmount this crucial issue since the suggested approaches did not attract the maj ority of the students and touch their learning style.

abstract={As part of their curriculum, many computer science departments offer an introductory software engineering course. This course normally provides an introduction to software engineering topics in conjunction with a semester long team project. The typical goals of this project are to provide students with a team based realistic software development project experience. To ensure students acquire the correct lessons from this project experience, it is essential that the teams utilize well-defined software development processes similar to those practised by leading software development organizations. Since its inception, the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) has served as a guide for organizations seeking to improve their development practices. The CMM identifies five levels of maturity, each of which exemplifies the utilization of key software engineering practices. Organizations can utilize the CMM to assess the maturity of their development processes via a self-assessment questionnaire, Although most organizations would like to believe their processes are mature, most are at the first two levels of maturity. In an effort to assess the maturity of development practices utilized in software engineering courses, an "academic" version of the CMM questionnaire was developed. This questionnaire was distributed to a sample of software engineering instructors in an effort to assess the maturity of academic software engineering course projects. The questionnaire and the survey results are presented and discussed. The goal of this effort is to provide an assessment of current software engineering course project education. As in the commercial world, this assessment will help pinpoint areas of improvement. It will also provide a challenge to software engineering instructors to "practice what they preach " and strive for higher levels of process maturity.},

abstract={Software engineering is one of the most demanding jobs in software industry nowadays and its demand keeps on increasing. However, there are several issues arise with regard to readiness of Information Technology (IT) or Computer Science (CS) graduates from the point of views of software industry. This perspective causes the supply of graduates mainly in software engineering field seems to be insufficient. The industry claims that the software engineering graduates are not able to meet their requirements in software industry. This is really surprising to the academia that offers software engineering specialisation or related programmes in IT or CS field. This phenomenon creates the gap between industry's requirements and graduates' readiness which indirectly reflects the gap between software engineering education and industry. A number of studies and frameworks are available to ponder the issues on software engineering education and industry. This paper reports the gap between industry's requirements and graduates' readiness in software engineering perspectives to face the real world. From the findings, we conclude that there is a gap due to high demands from the industry in highly skilled fresh graduates. In contrast, future graduates are still lack of confidence and readiness though they specialise in software engineering field that has more job opportunities in IT or CS field.},

abstract={The development of stand-alone software engineering curricula has spawned the need for a reevaluation of the survey courses designed to introduce software engineering to the non-software engineer (e.g. computer engineers or computer scientists). The Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Software Engineering (SE2004) and the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) are two widely accepted guidelines for knowledge areas within software engineering. This paper will examine the recommendations in these guidelines and suggest an appropriate subset of course topic areas and depth of coverage for a software engineering service course. The syllabus for senior-level 4-credit quarter-long service course in software engineering for computer engineers will be presented along with anecdotal evidence of its success as the course is taught at the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE). Recent curriculum changes in computer engineering at MSOE have shifted the software engineering service course from 4-credits in the senior year to 3-credits in the sophomore year and the proposed syllabus for this new course will be presented as well.},

abstract={Software Engineering is important for the students majored in computer science and technology. This curriculum is intended to provide students with an overall view over Software Engineering as an engineering discipline and with insight into the processes of software development. Creating software Engineering curriculum faces several challenges: (1) Software Engineering has wide coverage, but teaching time is limited. So it is difficult to make in-depth education. (2) Some introductory Software Engineering courses present the principles in isolation from practice. Teaching the lectures seems to focus on philosophy and methodology level, which leads to difficulty for students having no practical experience to understand. (3) Due to the lack of software project practice, students can hardly apply appropriate software engineering methods and technologies to solve problems. (4) How can Software Engineering curriculum satisfy the various needs of different levels? This paper focuses on the challenges above, and introduces how to try to solve them by a case study on the construction of Software Engineering curriculum at Peking University. Finally, this paper gives the future direction for the construction of Software Engineering curriculum.},

abstract={Metaheuristic techniques such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing and tabu search have found wide application in most areas of engineering. These techniques have also been applied in business, financial and economic modelling. Metaheuristics have been applied to three areas of software engineering: test data generation, module clustering and cost/effort prediction, yet there remain many software engineering problems which have yet to be tackled using metaheuristics. It is surprising that metaheuristics have not been more widely applied to software engineering; many problems in software engineering are characterised by precisely the features which make metaheuristics search applicable. In the paper it is argued that the features which make metaheuristics applicable for engineering and business applications outside software engineering also suggest that there is great potential for the exploitation of metaheuristics within software engineering. The paper briefly reviews the principal metaheuristic search techniques and surveys existing work on the application of metaheuristics to the three software engineering areas of test data generation, module clustering and cost/effort prediction. It also shows how metaheuristic search techniques can be applied to three additional areas of software engineering: maintenance/evolution system integration and requirements scheduling. The software engineering problem areas considered thus span the range of the software development process, from initial planning, cost estimation and requirements analysis through to integration, maintenance and evolution of legacy systems. The aim is to justify the claim that many problems in software engineering can be reformulated as search problems, to which metaheuristic techniques can be applied. The goal of the paper is to stimulate greater interest in metaheuristic search as a tool of optimisation of software engineering problems and to encourage the investigation and exploitation of these technologies in finding near optimal solutions to the complex constraint-based scenarios which arise so frequently in software engineering.},

abstract={Background: Software engineering is a core subject in computing education. Today, there seems to be a consensus that teaching software engineering requires students to perform practical experiences that simulate the work in the software industry. This represents a challenge for universities and instructors, because these experiences are complex to setup and involve considerable time and effort. Although there are several experiences and proposals reported in the literature, there is no clear solution to address this challenge. Aim: Being knowledgeable about the several approaches reported in the literature for dealing with this challenge is the first step to proposing a new solution. Counting on this knowledge allows instructors to reuse lessons learned from other universities. In order to address this challenge, we conducted a systematic mapping study that intends to answer the following questions: What are the main approaches used to address the practical experiences in software engineering education? Is there an emerging tendency to address this challenge? Which software process models are used to support the practical experiences in software engineering courses? Have the universities changed the way of conducting these experiences over the years? What are the main forums to seek information on practical approaches for teaching software engineering? Method: We used a systematic mapping study to identify and classify available research papers that report the use of practical experiences in software engineering education. Results: There were 173 papers selected, analyzed and classified. The results indicate that universities have realized the value of including practical experiences as part of the software engineering teaching process. However, few proposals indicate how to address that challenge. The practical approaches identified in this study were game learning, case studies, simulation, inverted classrooms, maintenance projects, service learning, and open sou- ce development. Only one recent report on the use of traditional approaches (i.e., teaching using expositive lectures) was found. The use of a development process to support these practical experiences seems not to be a concern for software engineering instructors. Only 40% of these studies report the use of a development process to guide the process experience. The reported processes are mainly agile methods. Conferences are the most used forum to publish studies in this area (72%). One third of these studies have been published over the last five years. Conclusion: There is a clear concern for teaching software engineering involving practical experiences, and there are several initiatives exploring how to do it. The map gives us an overview of the different proposals to address this challenge, and also allows us to make some preliminary conclusions about the preferred approaches.},

abstract={The Space Shuttle avionics software represents a successful integration of many of the computer industry's most advanced software engineering practices and approaches. Beginning in the late 1970s this software development and maintenance project has evolved one of the world's most mature software processes applying the principles of the highest levels of the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model, Trusted Software Methodology, and ISO 9001 standards. This software process, considered to be a “best practice” by many software industry organizations includes state-of-the-practice software reliability engineering methodologies. Life-critical Shuttle avionics software produced by this process is recognized to be among the highest quality and highest reliability software in operation in the world. This case study explores the successful use of extremely detailed fault and failure history, throughout the software life cycle, in the application of software reliability engineering techniques to gain insight into the flight-worthiness of the software and to suggest “where to look” for remaining defects. The role of software reliability models and failure prediction techniques is examined and explained to allow the use of these approaches on other software projects. One of the most important aspects of such an approach, how to use and interpret the results of the application of such techniques, is addressed},
